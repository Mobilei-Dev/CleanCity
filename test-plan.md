## CleanCity App ‚Äì Test Plan
### Objective
Ensure the CleanCity App delivers a seamless, secure, and scalable experience for users reporting urban cleanliness issues, tracking waste pickup, and engaging in community initiatives.

### Strategy Overview
This test plan adopts a Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) mindset, focusing on how real users interact with the app. It emphasizes:

User stories as the foundation for test scenarios

Impact-based prioritization (e.g., public health, civic engagement)

Continuous feedback loops with testers, users, and city officials

Agile sprint-based execution with evolving test artifacts

### Scope

Geo-tagged issue reporting

Push notifications for waste pickup

Admin dashboard for municipal staff

Community leaderboard and gamification

Accessibility features (e.g., screen reader support)

‚ùå Out of Scope:
Payment integrations

Third-party analytics (Phase 2)

## üß™ Test Types & Techniques

| **Test Type**            | **Technique Used**                         | **Purpose**                                                                 |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚úÖ Functional Testing     | BDD with Gherkin syntax                    | Validates expected app behavior against business/user scenarios              |
| üéØ Usability Testing      | Heuristic evaluation + user surveys       | Evaluates ease of use, navigation clarity, and user satisfaction             |
| ‚ôø Accessibility Testing  | WCAG 2.1 compliance checks                 | Ensures inclusive design: screen reader support, contrast, keyboard access   |
| üöÄ Performance Testing    | Load simulation via JMeter                 | Assesses responsiveness under normal and high usage loads                    |
| üîí Security Testing       | OWASP Mobile Top 10 audit                  | Identifies vulnerabilities like insecure storage, improper authentication    |
| üåç Localization Testing   | Language toggling + RTL support           | Confirms support for multiple languages and correct layout for RTL users     |

## üßº BDD Test Scenario
### üß™ Feature: Report a Cleanliness Issue

```gherkin
Scenario: Citizen reports overflowing garbage bin
  Given the user is logged in
  And is within GPS range of a public bin
  When they tap "Report Issue"
  And upload a photo and select "Overflowing Bin"
  Then the issue should be logged with timestamp and location
  And a confirmation message should be displayed

### Test Strategy

| **Component**   | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Test Levels** | Unit, Integration, System, and Acceptance testing will be conducted to ensure quality at each development stage. |
| **Test Types**  | Testing will cover Functional, Usability, Performance, Security, and Regression aspects. |
| **Techniques**  | Test design techniques include Black-box testing, Exploratory testing, Boundary Value Analysis, and Equivalence Partitioning. |
| **Approach**    | UI/UX tests will be performed manually for user experience evaluation. Automated testing will be used for regression and API endpoints to ensure efficiency and consistency. |
