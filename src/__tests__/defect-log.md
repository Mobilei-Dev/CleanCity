## üß† Observations & Warnings

- Multiple components reference `ReactDOMTestUtils.act()`, which is deprecated. Migration to `React.act()` is recommended to avoid future regressions.
- React Router v7 future flags (`startTransition`, `relativeSplatPath`) emit warnings. These are expected and not test-breaking, but upgrades should be tracked.
- Console noise (warnings and errors) is common in test output; consider using `jest.spyOn(console, 'warn')` and silencing expected logs during CI runs.

## üöß Next Steps

- ‚úÖ Migrate deprecated testing utilities where flagged.
- üîç Audit remaining warnings for suppressibility or upgrade readiness.
- üß™ Run full suite with upgraded React and Router versions on staging branch.
- üìù Document mitigation steps and verify defect closure in GitHub Issues or JIRA if applicable.
